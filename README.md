# kis2kml
A python script to parse Kismet netxml into a SQL database and query it to generate Google Earth KML files.

I don't mind Giskismet, it does the job relatively well, but I wanted to be able make use of Signal strength information in SQL queries, to filter networks that one could realistically attach to. I found Perl too hard to learn, so I wrote a Python script to do the job.
